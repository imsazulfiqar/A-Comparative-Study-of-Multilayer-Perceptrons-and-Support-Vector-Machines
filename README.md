The objective of this research is to provide critical evaluations and comparisons of the performance of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on Census income data. Different models for each of the algorithms were tested using different hyperparameters using a grid search approach. It was observed that regularization constants played a role in determining the best hyperparameters, but they were not the sole determinants. SVM outperformed MLP when the models were evaluated using ROC curves, validation curves and confusion matrix.
